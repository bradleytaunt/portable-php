# How to generate this HTML file

Get [portable-php](https://github.com/cadars/portable-php/ "portable-php at Github") to render Markdown&nbsp;files as HTML.[^1]

1. Write posts in `/content`
2. Open `http://example.com/portable.php` in your browser
3. Save as `index.html`

[^1]:Disclaimer: This barebones script is adapted from ten years old PHP.net comments, Stack Overflow snippets, and long forgotten Gists. It miraculously works (?) but it probably should not be hosted on a public web&nbsp;server.
